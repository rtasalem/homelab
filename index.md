This wiki is for documenting *every single step* taken in setting up my own homelab. There are a couple sections in this wiki that are not strictly to do with homelabbing or self-hosting, but nonetheless are valuable lessons I've learned in the process.

## Contents (A-Z)

[Cloudflare](/docs/cloudflare/README.md)  
[Docker](/docs/docker/README.md)

## Running the homelab

Please refer to the project's [`README`](./README.md) for full details on how to run this homelab.

This wiki is for documenting *every single step* taken in setting up my own homelab. There are a couple sections in this wiki that are not strictly to do with homelabbing or self-hosting, but nonetheless are valuable lessons I've learned in the process.

## Contents (A-Z)

[Cloudflare](/docs/cloudflare/README.md)  
[Docker](/docs/docker/README.md)  
[Network](./docs/network/README.md)

## Available services (A-Z)

[Bin It!](https://github.com/rtasalem/bin-it) - Custom Python application I built to automate email reminders for my bin collection days.  
[Cloudflared](./compose.cloudflared.yaml) - A.k.a. the Cloudflare daemon to support the use of Cloudflare tunnels.  
[Portainer](./compose.portainer.yaml) - GUI for managing container environments, specifically Docker containers.  

## Running the homelab

Please refer to the project's [`README`](./README.md) for full details on how to run this homelab.

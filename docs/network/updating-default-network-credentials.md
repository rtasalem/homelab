# Updating Default Network Credentials
Best practice for all local networks, whether you use a homelab or not is to change the default passwords and SSID (service set identifier). This secures your network from hackers who may easily guess default admin passwords and other credentials.
## Changing SSID & Passwords
On your browser, navigate to `htp://192.168.0.1`. Enter the admin username and password for your router (these are typically available on the router itself). Once logged in you should see various options including, change WiFi name (or change SSID), change WiFi password, and change admin password. It is recommended to change all of these as their default values are more easily guessed, making your local network vulnerable.
